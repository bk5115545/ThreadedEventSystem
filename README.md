# ThreadedEventSystem
This was my advanced game programming final project.  It allows you to bind functions to generic events that you can trigger yourself.  The cool part is that event-registered-function execute in the background (so the main thread is free to do other things).


This project is very out of date.  Several orders of magnitude of performance improvements have been implemented in https://github.com/bk5115545/The-Event-Engine.  Breaking changes were also introduced so they changes have not been merged back.  This repoisitory is only an archived reference.
